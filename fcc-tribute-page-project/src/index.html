      <h3 id="bio-title">Early Life</h3>
      <p> Zdzislaw Beksinski was born in Sanok, Poland on February 24th, 1929. He spent his childhood growing up during World War II, Where later he studied architecture at a university in Kraków. He returned to his hometown in Sanok and became a construction
        site supervisor for several years. Beksinski grew to hate his job, due to the pressure and countless boring details that come with the postion. During this period he grew and interest in photography and sculpting, where he would use construction
        materials as his medium. Beksinski's photography would be an early display of themes of desolate landscapes and anxiety later depicted in his paintings. </p>

      <h3 id="bio-title">Artistic Development</h3>
      <p>Beksiński had no formal training as an artist, his only background was in architecture. This didn't stop him from gaining critical praise for his photography starting in 1958, which inspired him to try a new medium, drawing. Beksiński made his drawings
        highly detailed and often quite large, nearly obsessive to the smallest details. He eventually threw himself into painting and grew a deep passion for it. Beksiński's paintings were mainly created using oil paint on hardboard panels which he personally
        prepared. During his creative process of painting, he would always listen to classical music as he detested silence. Beksiński saw his first major success in 1964 at an exhibition is Warsaw as all his painting were sold. This fueled Beksiński's
        passion for painting, where he eventually became the leading figure in contemporary Polish art. </p>
